## easy-file-compare

This script compares two text files containing blocks of text
and outputs the differences in both console and markdown format.
It is designed to handle blocks of text that start with a specific header
and end with a specific footer, allowing for structured comparison of configuration files
or similar structured text files.

Note: This script assumes that the input files are structured correctly
